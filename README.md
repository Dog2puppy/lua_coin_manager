# LuaCoin: An encrypted database system for ROBLOX. 
## About
LuaCoin is a ROBLOX encryption database system that allows creators to effectively keep certain data (such as currency) safe without the worries of some exploiter finding a way to manipulate with their scores.

## Features
LuaCoin has some pretty straight forward features that are suppose to work. These features include
* A randomly generated encryption number. 
* Functions that allows any script to save specific data.
* Simple, easy to use functions.
Keep in mind that LuaCoin is still in **ALPHA**. So there are many features that are still being planned. Hopefully by Beta, there will be even more features.
